# PDE_project

Finite-element nonlinear cardiac mechanics implementation.

## What this repo contains

- A parallel deal.II code that solves a nonlinear equilibrium problem using a Newton method with backtracking line search.
- A vector-valued displacement unknown $u \in \mathbb{R}^3$ (3D).
- A hyperelastic material implemented via automatic differentiation (AD): energy density $W(F)$, with
	- first Piola–Kirchhoff stress $P = \partial W/\partial F$
	- consistent tangent $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}F$ (for Newton)



## Build Requirements

The project is configured through CMake and relies on:

- C++17 compiler
- MPI
- deal.II 9.3.1
- Boost >= 1.72 (filesystem, iostreams, serialization)

Notes:
- deal.II must be compiled with Trilinos enabled (the code uses TrilinosWrappers).
- Sacado comes from Trilinos (used for scalar extraction/AD-related utilities).

## Build

Minimal build steps (from the repository root):

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


The executable is built as:

- `build/cardiac.o`

## Run

Run with MPI (even single or multiple rank):

```bash
cd build
mpirun -n 1 ./cardiac.o
```


```bash
mpirun -n 4 ./cardiac.o
```

### Selecting the mesh

The input mesh is currently hard-coded in [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp) via:

- `ventricular_mesh_path = "../ventricular_meshes/msh/ventricle_0_7.msh"`

It is also possible to switch to a slab mesh under `mesh/` (also `.msh`) by changing that path.

## Output

The code writes parallel VTU output (PVTU + per-rank VTU pieces) to the current working directory:

- `output-<mesh_stem>_0.pvtu`
- `output-<mesh_stem>_0_*.vtu`

The `.pvtu` can be opened in ParaView.

In addition to the displacement vector field (`solution`), the output also includes a derived scalar field:

- `solution_mag`: magnitude of the displacement, i.e. $|u|$

## Code structure

- [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp)
	- Program entry point and high-level workflow.
	- Instantiates `LV`, then calls `setup()`, `solve_newton()`, and `output()`.

- [src/left_ventricle.hpp](src/left_ventricle.hpp), [src/left_ventricle.cpp](src/left_ventricle.cpp)
	- `LV` class: mesh/FE initialization, assembly, Newton solver, output.
	- `compute_rhs()` assembles:
		- residual vector (stored in `system_rhs`)
		- Jacobian matrix (stored in `jacobian_matrix`)

- [src/tensor_utils.hpp](src/tensor_utils.hpp), [src/tensor_utils.cpp](src/tensor_utils.cpp)
	- Material routine based on an energy density $W(F)$.
	- Uses deal.II AD to compute stress and consistent tangent:
		- gradient of $W$ wrt $F$ entries → $P$
		- Hessian of $W$ wrt $F$ entries → $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}F$

- [src/system_assembler.hpp](src/system_assembler.hpp), [src/system_assembler.cpp](src/system_assembler.cpp)
	- Utility for assembling Jacobians of generic vector functions via AD(currently unused).

## Boundary IDs

Boundary conditions are applied by boundary id in [src/left_ventricle.cpp](src/left_ventricle.cpp).
The code prints the boundary IDs present in the mesh during `setup()`.

Current conventions used in assembly:

- Dirichlet: `boundary_id == 2` (displacement fixed to zero)
- Neumann-like term: `boundary_id == 3`
- Robin-like term: `boundary_id == 4`


## Notes on the nonlinear solve

- Newton iterations assemble residual/Jacobian each step.
- A backtracking line search is used to avoid invalid states (all 0 residuals and nans)

## Doubts and Questions
- *Unexpected asymmetry with the isotropic Neo- Hooke model*: the displacement magnitude is not symmetric, even though the Neo-Hookean material is isotropic.
	- Could the asymmetry come from mesh quality/local refinement, element orientation, or partitioning/output artifacts?
	- Is the problem symmetric (geometry, boundary IDs/BCs, applied loads/tractions)?
	- If the problem is symmetric, is it actually converging?

- *Units & scaling (consistency checks)*: how can we verify that geometry, material parameters ($\mu,\kappa$). We didn't find any sources online using the Neo-Hooke implementation.

- *Stability and convergence*: How should we study the stability of the solution?


- *Neo-Hookean variant (not unique)*: 
    We used the following neo Hooke Implementation (isochoric–volumetric split energy). We don't know if it is correct


- *Newton robustness / Jacobian correctness*: how can we confirm that the assembled Jacobian is consistent with the residual? (probably implementing AD to solve the jacobian would solve this problem)
